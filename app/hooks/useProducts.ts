    // the useEffect below. Without useCallback, every render would produce a
    // new function reference, which would trigger the effect again, causing
    // another fetch, another state update, another render — an infinite loop.
    // The empty array [] means the function is only created once (on mount).

    // The dependency array [fetchProducts] tells React: "re-run this effect

    // useCallback here is optional (there is no useEffect depending on it),

    // component wrapped in React.memo (tells React to skip re-rendering a component 
    // if its props haven't changed.), a stable reference prevents that child
    // from re-rendering unnecessarily every time the parent renders.

        // Some REST APIs use PATCH instead of PUT for partial updates —
        // change method: "PUT" to method: "PATCH" if your backend requires it.
